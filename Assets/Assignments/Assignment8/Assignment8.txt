Assignment 8:

The goal is to create a simple RTS where two AI controlled Farms compete over resources. There are two types of NPC:s:
-Farmers
	- Farmers move slower than Woodcutters
	- Farmers plant Carrots in Farmland if there is free space for Carrots in Farmland
	- It takes some time for the Carrot to grow
	- When a Carrot is fully grown, the Farmer picks up the Carrot and carries it to the CarrotStorage
	- If the Farmer spots an opposing Woodcutter, it will try to run away
	- Farmer can not attack
-Woodcutters
	- Woodcutters go to the Forest to cut down Trees
	- The Tree should take a number of hits to cut
	- Once the Tree has been cut, it should fall and turn in to a log
	- The Woodcutter should pick up the Log and carry it to their Logpile
	- If the Woodcutter sees an enemy they will stop what they are doing and attack the enemy
